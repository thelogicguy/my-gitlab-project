# Example: .github/workflows/node.js.yml

# Name of the workflow
name: Node.js CI

# Specifies when the workflow should be triggered
on:
# Triggers the workflow on 'push' events to the 'main' branch
push:
    branches: [ main ]
# Also triggers the workflow on 'pull_request' events targeting the 'main' branch
pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Defines the jobs that the workflow will execute
jobs:
# Job identifier, can be any name (here it's 'build')
build:
    # Specifies the type of virtual host environment (runner) to use
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Strategy for running the jobs - this section is useful for testing across multiple environments
    strategy:
    # A matrix build strategy to test against multiple versions of Node.js
    matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so the job can access it
    uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - # Sets up the specified version of Node.js
    name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - # Installs node modules as specified in the project's package-lock.json
    run: npm ci

    - # This command will only run if a build script is defined in the package.json
    run: npm run build --if-present

    - # Runs tests as defined in the project's package.json
    run: npm test
